# Programming language filename format documentation

## File name: "python_instruction_format.md"

### Description:
 This documnet content all program file that covers every topic needed to understand python topics clearly with a little bit of explanation please note this "Repository" is still under development and will be updated frequently and does not cover that much detailed topics.The level is for beginners to moderate learners.

### File naming Logic:
 The filename is structured as follows:
 - The filename with only Eg:"for" indicates that the content is related to that topic.

 - The filename with only Eg:"for_dict_(So..on)" specifies it combines two topics: "for loops" and "dictionaries" into one file and uses it as a example 

 - If the filename ends with "for_dict2",means it has two examples.
 
 - If the filename ends with a seprated number"import_api_1"this means the file is connected to folder named "museum_1"and contains programs conencted to it or it necessary for the running of the older file 

 -- There are some file name with parenthesis "()" plz rename the file before running it (a simple filename Eg: xyz.py)
